Automotive stocks are shares of publicly traded companies that design, manufacture or supply components for motor vehicles. Owning these stocks gives investors a slice of the automaker’s (or parts supplier’s) profits and exposes them to industry-specific risks and opportunities, such as shifts in consumer demand, regulatory changes, and technological advances like electric vehicles. These companies had the highest dollar trading volume of any Automotive stocks within the last several days.",
